When people run in circles its a very, very...mad world.

I like beer. I like sake when I eat sushi. Even when eating sushi I sometimes prefer beer. During the winter I lean towards hot sake instead of beer but don't limit myself to circumstances of weather. Whether 'tis cold or hot, true self will out. Cheers and bottoms up!
